Last semester, my partner and I created an app called CityXplore, a web application that creates location-based itineraries for users to explore nearby restaurants, museums, and other activities. In this Independent Work, I aim to determine if personalized machine learning models lead to better restaurant recommendations, and if so, which model works best. To do this, I use the Yelp dataset, which has restaurant, user, and reviews data. I perform Natural Language Processing on the reviews text data, and use that as features. For the recommender system, I use a simple baseline that uses the Yelp ratings to make predictions. I test a Na√Øve Bayes model, a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model-based collaborative technique, as well as a weighted content-collaborative hybrid model. I evaluate the models using MAE, RMSE, R-squared, and Spearman correlation. I found that the Naive Bayes model performed the strongest.
